## About the Project

I built this project as a personal full-stack application to strengthen my backend development skills, understand authentication flows, and work with a real database. The app allows each user to have their own account and manage their own tasks securely.

The backend is built with **Node.js and Express**, while **MongoDB** is used for persistent data storage. On the frontend, I integrated external libraries such as **FullCalendar** and **Flatpickr** to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication** – Users can sign up, log in, and have their own private tasks  
- **CRUD Operations** – Create, read, update, and delete tasks  
- **Calendar Integration (FullCalendar)** – Visual scheduling of tasks  
- **Date Selection (Flatpickr)** – Easy and interactive date picking  
- **Persistent Storage** – Tasks are stored in MongoDB  
- **Clean UI** – Simple and user-friendly design  
- **Real-time Updates** – Changes reflect immediately in the UI

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **APIs / Libraries:** FullCalendar, Flatpickr

## What I Built

Since this was a personal project, I was responsible for the full development lifecycle, including:

- Designing and implementing the frontend UI  
- Building RESTful API routes with Express  
- Implementing user authentication and session handling  
- Designing the MongoDB schema for users and tasks  
- Integrating FullCalendar and Flatpickr  
- Testing, debugging, and refining the app over time
